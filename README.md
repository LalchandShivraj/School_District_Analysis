# School Data Analysis Project

## Overview
The School Board has evidence that the Thomas High School 9th grade scores have been compromised and thus they must be removed from the analysis:

. Replace the ninth-grade reading and math scores with NaN
. Repeat the school district analysis

### Prior work done.
Analysis of the key metrics for each school of the district. Following are the deliverables Maria is looking for:

1. A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics.
2. An overview of the key metrics for each school.
3. Top and bottom 5 perfoming schools based on overall passing rate.
4. Average of math and reading by students in each grade level.
5. School's performance based on Budget, Size and Type.

## Resources
- Data Source: schools_complete.csv, students_complete.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Jupyter Notebook (incl. pandas & numpy)
- Output: PyCitySchools_Challenge.ipynb and .png files attached in the summary.

## Summary
The exclusion of Thomas High School's 9th grade scores did not impact the overall performance of the school as it remained in second place.
Similarly, the District Summary comparison shows minimal changes.
